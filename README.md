# User Personas

## Gamer:

The user interacts with the system to personalize their profile by creating an account, setting up a display name, avatar, bio, and other details. They can customize privacy settings for both their profiles and journals, ensuring control over visibility. Users can also create and view game lists, adding games, descriptions, and managing the lists' visibility settings. Additionally, they engage in social interactions by adding friends, sending messages, leaving comments, and upvoting or downvoting content. For events, users can register, track upcoming and past events, and share event details with others.

## Game Creator:

The Creator designs and customizes game lists, deciding how they want them to be structured and presented. They can manage the visibility of these lists, setting them as private, friend-only, or public. Over time, they can add more games to the lists and allow others to comment if they grant access.

## Gaming Event Organizers:

The Event Organizer is responsible for creating events that are visible to users on the platform. They can modify, reschedule, or cancel events as needed. Additionally, they track user registrations for events and update participants accordingly. The Event Organizer also engages with users to help them discover and attend events that may interest them.
